# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In this project I created a webpage to organize notes and teach me along the way. This page provides a simple but interesting way to display thoughts, lessons, and put into action those ideas. I learned about HTML, JS, CSS, and even how to operate a terminal and open tools like VS through it!
